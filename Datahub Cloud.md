## Flowershow cloud onboarding

**Quickly sharing content with other people.**

Difficult when the person doesn't have a use case. Or doesn't have their digital garden already. Flowershow is mostly for people who already have markdown files and are using some Editor and they want to publish it. Idea is to have all Obsidian features supported as well. Eg. People publish their vaults with Obsidian publish. 

**Yoana's feedback re Flowershow:**
* Formatting issues
	* eg. Alignments. Ola: Not possible to have different alignments. We don't even know how to implement it. 
* I want my personal notes to be neat. Uploading pictures I want to put 10 pictures, there is no gallery component - infinite scroll of pictures. 

**Actions:**
* Yoana to update the Misc issue on the product repo. 
	* Style of the page. Format of the page. Ola is aware and she will add some styles from the Flowershow template. 
	* Custom Domain error/instruction message should be different. More specifically what should be the format?

### Observations

If there are no specific questions, Onboarding is stuck after the site is deployed.

Datahub Cloud vs Flowershow Cloud

Datahub Cloud will be for data users and for creating data portals ^^ we will have data queries, datarich stuff.

While flowershow will tackle all types of users

[https://flowershow.app/cloud](https://flowershow.app/cloud)



--------------

In Datahub cloud, you want to be able to create datasets.

What is a data portal? Something that has a data catalog and datasets.

Application where you can search through the data or metadata catalog and discover and explore specific datasets 

MarkdownDB - let"s say I have hundreds of md files and then you use MarkdownDB as a catalog and database 

I need an example. 

---- 
Roadmap and to backlog of items:

1. Landing page of the datahub cloud which is going to be on datahub.io -- Ola is already working on this (similar page on Flowershow cloud). It will be ready tomorrow latest
	1. Content: what should be described on the page 
	2. We can reuse a lot of Flowershowapp and repurpose it.
2. B2C
3. Examples how the product can be used
4. What features do we have
	1. datarich could be a main feature
	2. markdowndb?

Simplicity of markdown


## V1 Github based Milestone

* Landing page is required - 
	* Content mostly 
	* Structure 
		* What components
		* What order
* Start creating the marketing strategy
* Create an issue for the minor bugs that have to be 
	* Checklists rendering
	* For Ola to check the custom domains and if this works
* Finalising flowershow cloud onboarding as a way to have some initial feedback from people. 

## Research and brainstorming for v2 of the product

Think through how this should work for people who don't want to use Github.

Backlog from a technical perspective:
*  We currently assume that the user has a GitHub account. We want to cover the people who aren't on Github as well.
	* 1. an option to use a GitHub repo 
	* 2. or start from scratch. If eg. you have datasets on your local machine. 
		* Maybe we create their github account and a repo. And the user uses some sort of editor directly in Datahub Cloud.  
	* You should be able to create this even if you are not on GitHub.
* Custom domains
	* Make sure it works. According to Ola this already works. 
* If you want to display a dataset in the form of a graph> how can we change this so that they
