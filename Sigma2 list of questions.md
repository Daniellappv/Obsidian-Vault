## Questions for Sigma 

1. Are we going to display the number of private and embargo datasets in the hero section?
2. Themes. 
	1. Do you already know what topics/themes you will have and 
	2. How many? 
	3. Are you projecting that the number increases in time? 
	4. Do you have associated images with these themes?
3. Dataset metadata attributes on the search page: 
	1. Currently, we have displayed the dataset AUTHOR on the mockup. This is the person who publishes the dataset in CKAN. I think you're calling this depositor. Can you please provide us with a list of the roles you have and what they mean (I image sth like a glossary)? 
	2. Which role(s) would you want to have as metadata attributes on the search page?
4. Filter facets: what filter facets do you require having? Eg. not sure that the timestamp one is even relevant, we took it from the prototype. 
5. On the prototype, per each dataset there is a field, a subfield and a domain. In ckan, we have topics and we can have hierarchy (subtopics). Can you give us the definitions of the field, subfield, and domain so that we know how to recreate this in CKAN? 
6. What is expected to display on the Citation tab on the dataset page? Will the user be able to perform any action there or is it just an informative list?
7. Downloading a dataset. Can we just confirm that you mean being able to download all resources/files from the dataset and not the whole dataset in bulk?
8. Tags. Design style. There was a comment from Franceska that the tags on the dataset page look like buttons. I would like to clarify something on the overall design style and guidelines. 
	1. Monika tried to create a seamless experience between the mockups and the new design guidelines that were provided to us. However, the guidelines are unclear (maybe because they are in a shape of mockups). For example, there are 3 different ways of displaying buttons there, see screenshots![[Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 14.52.19.png]]

Which ones are we supposed to adapt and follow? 
9. In the contact tab on the dataset page, which roles are to be displayed? Currently, we have Author (Creator) and Maintainer (Editor).
## Actions for Monika

1. Update the radio button in the filter facets to a checklist type.
2. Remove the number of downloads from both the search and the dataset page
