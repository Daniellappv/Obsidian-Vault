## Strategy

"Strategy is about choosing to do some things and not other things"

**Only 5 choices to be made**:
1. What is our winning aspiration?
2. Where will we play? 
3. How will we win?
4. What capabilities must we have?
5. What management systems are required?

### What is our winning aspiration?

What's the scale (total number of "vehicles")?
To check. 
### Where will we play?

Where are we going to win? Where to play is always a choice. 

Eg. We want to be the best in data catalogs market or data portals market or ckan market or Saas market or what market or niche 

### How will we win?

Starbucks example. Experiencing it differently. The value proposition. Doing something different than our competitors.

### What capabilities must we have?

We want to win with... 

who do we want to attract, where are they, how do we reach them and what skillset or what experts we need in our team to do that.

### What management systems are required? 

Management systems are needed to ensure those capabilities and built and maintained

Ensuring our service is exceptional

4 seasons' example was GREAT

If the guest is upset, because eg. their card is taking too long to load, or they couldn't get a restaurant reservation at the time they wanted. Recorded as a glitch. Every morning, the personnel from the manager on down gather and go through the glitch report and agree on actions to take in order to compensate the guests for these glitches; in the end, the guest is made to feel great that the glitch happened because they'll get something wonderful, eg theater tickets.

"Eliminating glitches is not the goal. The only way to eliminate glitches is to lower the bar until glitches are not called glitches anymore."

so that the standard gets better and better.
